# Primitive Components
All projects in Clutch include a set of foundational components known as "Primitives." These components are the building blocks for most projects, seamlessly integrated with our theming system and designed with intuitiveness in mind.

## Block

Our Link component is built on top of the Next [Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) component.
